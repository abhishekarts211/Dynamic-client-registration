Dynamic client registration (Example 4)
 

A developer attempts to dynamically register a public client that supports the authorization code flow with PKCE, uses refresh tokens, has a single redirect URI, and requires the restricted scope dev_reg. The client uses no client secret (token_endpoint_auth_method: none), as is typical for public clients like mobile or JavaScript applications.

PingFederate is configured to:

Require an initial access token for all dynamic client registrations.

Enforce scope restrictions, where certain scopes (such as dev_reg) are required for specific clients and are marked as restricted.

The developer sends a registration request with an incorrect scope in the request body, such as a scope that does not include the required restricted scope dev_reg. Since the dev_reg scope is a mandatory scope for the registration, the request will fail with an error indicating the incorrect scope.
